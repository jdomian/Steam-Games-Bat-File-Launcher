# Steam-Games-Bat-File-Launcher
This takes bat scripts and converts them into a separate .exe file and .bat file that the .exe file needs to execute. I created this to add .bat scripts to launch in the Steam App for Big Picture Mode. The .bat scripts are reconfigured as .exe so they can be selected from the Steam App.
